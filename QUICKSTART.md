# GSD Universal - Quick Start Guide

**Get from idea to working code in 15 minutes.**

---

## What is GSD?

GSD (Get Shit Done) is a framework for building software with AI assistants. It works with **any AI** (ChatGPT, Claude, Kiro, etc.) in **any environment** (web, IDE, terminal).

**Core idea**: Break work into phases, plan each phase, execute with fresh context, verify results.

---

## Prerequisites

- Git installed
- Text editor (any)
- AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Kiro, or any other)
- 15 minutes

---

## Installation

### Option 1: Automated Installer (Recommended)

**Windows:**
```cmd
# Clone GSD Universal
git clone https://github.com/yura9011/GSD-universal.git
cd GSD-universal

# Run installer
install.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
# Clone GSD Universal
git clone https://github.com/yura9011/GSD-universal.git
cd GSD-universal

# Make installer executable and run
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer will:
1. Ask for your project directory path
2. Copy all GSD files (.gsd/, scripts/, loop files, etc.)
3. Optionally copy documentation
4. Set up proper permissions
5. Show you next steps

**Time**: 1-2 minutes

### Option 2: Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone GSD
git clone https://github.com/your-org/gsd-universal.git my-project
cd my-project

# Remove GSD git history
rm -rf .git

# Initialize your project
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with GSD"
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone GSD
git clone https://github.com/yura9011/GSD-universal.git my-project
cd my-project

# Remove GSD git history
rm -rf .git

# Initialize your project
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with GSD"
```

### Option 3: Add to Existing Project

1. Download GSD from GitHub
2. Copy `.gsd/` folder to your project
3. Copy `scripts/` folder to your project
4. Copy `loop.sh` and `loop.ps1` to your project
5. Copy `PROMPT_build.md` and `PROMPT_plan.md` to your project
6. Copy `AGENTS.md` to your project

---

## First Project (New Codebase)

### Step 1: Define Your Project

Open your AI assistant and say:

```
I want to use GSD framework to build a project.
Please read .gsd/workflows/new-project.md and help me define:
- Project vision
- Requirements
- Roadmap with phases
```

**What happens**:
- AI asks questions about your project
- You answer (goals, constraints, tech stack)
- AI creates: `PROJECT.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATE.md`

**Time**: 5-10 minutes

### Step 2: Plan First Phase

Once you have a roadmap, plan the first phase:

```
Please read .gsd/workflows/plan.md and help me plan Phase 1.
Create detailed execution plans.
```

**What happens**:
- AI researches how to implement the phase
- AI creates 2-3 atomic task plans
- Each plan is small enough to execute in one session

**Time**: 3-5 minutes

### Step 3: Execute with Ralph Loop

Now execute the plans using Ralph Loop:

**Option A: Interactive Mode** (works with any AI)

```bash
# Start Ralph Loop
./loop.sh

# Ralph shows you the prompt
# Copy prompt to your AI
# AI executes, makes changes
# Press ENTER when AI is done
# Ralph validates changes
# Ralph commits if validation passes
# Loop continues with next task
```

**Option B: Automated Mode** (if you have AI CLI)

```bash
# If you have claude, kiro, or other AI CLI
./loop.sh --auto

# Ralph feeds prompts to AI automatically
# Validates after each task
# Commits when validation passes
# Continues until all tasks done
```

**Time**: Varies (AI does the work)

### Step 4: Verify Results

After execution, verify the work:

```
Please read .gsd/workflows/verify.md and help me verify Phase 1.
Check that all requirements are met.
```

**What happens**:
- AI checks deliverables
- You test the actual functionality
- AI documents verification results

**Time**: 2-3 minutes

### Step 5: Repeat

Continue with next phases:
1. Plan phase → Execute → Verify
2. Repeat until milestone complete
3. Ship!

## Existing Project (Brownfield)

Already have code? Start here:

### Step 1: Add GSD to Your Project

```bash
# In your existing project
cd my-existing-project

# Copy GSD files (assuming you cloned GSD to ../gsd-universal)
cp -r ../gsd-universal/.gsd .
cp -r ../gsd-universal/scripts .
cp ../gsd-universal/loop.sh .
cp ../gsd-universal/loop.ps1 .
cp ../gsd-universal/PROMPT_*.md .
cp ../gsd-universal/AGENTS.md .

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add GSD framework"
```

### Step 2: Index Your Codebase

```bash
# Generate codebase intelligence
./scripts/index-codebase.sh

# This creates .gsd/intel/ with:
# - index.json (exports/imports)
# - conventions.json (detected patterns)
# - graph.json (dependencies)
# - summary.md (AI-readable summary)
```

### Step 3: Map Your Codebase

Open your AI and say:

```
I have an existing codebase and want to use GSD.
Please read .gsd/intel/summary.md to understand my codebase.
Then read .gsd/workflows/map.md and help me document:
- Architecture
- File structure
- Key patterns
```

**What happens**:
- AI reads intelligence summary
- AI understands your codebase structure
- AI creates architecture documentation

### Step 4: Define What to Build Next

```
Now that you understand my codebase, let's define what to build next.
Please read .gsd/workflows/new-milestone.md and help me:
- Define the next feature/milestone
- Create requirements
- Plan phases
```

### Step 5: Continue as Normal

From here, same as new project:
- Plan phase → Execute → Verify → Repeat

## Working with Different AIs

### ChatGPT (Web)

**How to use workflows**:
```
1. Open workflow file in your editor
2. Copy entire content
3. Paste into ChatGPT
4. ChatGPT will guide you through the workflow
```

**File references**:
- ChatGPT can't read files directly
- You'll need to copy file contents when asked
- Example: "Please read PROJECT.md" → Copy PROJECT.md content

**Context limits**:
- ChatGPT has conversation limits
- Start new conversation for each phase
- Keep conversations focused

### Claude (Web)

**How to use workflows**:
```
1. Open workflow file
2. Copy content
3. Paste into Claude
4. Claude will guide you
```

**File references**:
- Claude can't read files directly in web
- Copy file contents when needed
- Use Claude Projects feature to upload files

**Context limits**:
- Claude has generous context window
- Can handle longer conversations
- Still recommended to start fresh per phase

### Kiro (IDE)

**How to use workflows**:
```
1. Reference workflow with #File
2. Example: "Follow #.gsd/workflows/new-project.md"
3. Kiro reads file automatically
```

**File references**:
- Kiro can read files directly
- Use #File or #Folder syntax
- Much more convenient

**Context**:
- Kiro has large context window
- Can handle complex projects
- Supports subagents for parallel work

### Terminal + Any AI CLI

**How to use workflows**:
```
1. Use Ralph Loop (loop.sh)

---

## Validation

Before marking any task complete, run validation:

**Windows**:
```powershell
./scripts/validate.ps1 -All
```

**Mac/Linux**:
```bash
./scripts/validate.sh --all
```

**What it checks**:
- Code syntax (language-specific linters)
- Workflow structure
- File structure
- Git status

---

## Tips for Success

### 1. Start Small
- Don't plan entire project upfront
- Plan 1-2 phases at a time
- Iterate and adjust

### 2. Keep Context Fresh
- Start new AI conversation per phase
- Don't let conversations get too long
- Ralph Loop handles this automatically

### 3. Use Validation
- Run validation before committing
- Validation is your backpressure
- Catches issues early

### 4. Trust the Process
- Let AI pick task order
- Don't micromanage
- Observe and adjust

### 5. Document Decisions
- Update STATE.md with important decisions
- Update AGENTS.md with operational learnings
- Keep IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md current

---

## Troubleshooting

### "AI doesn't understand the workflow"

**Solution**: Copy the entire workflow file content and paste it to AI. Be explicit: "Follow these instructions exactly."

### "Validation fails"

**Solution**: 
1. Read error message
2. Fix the issue
3. Run validation again
4. Don't commit until validation passes

### "Ralph Loop doesn't work"

**Solution**:
1. Check you have `PROMPT_build.md` or `PROMPT_plan.md`
2. Check you have `AGENTS.md`
3. Try `./loop.sh --help` for usage
4. Use interactive mode if automated fails

### "AI makes inconsistent changes"

**Solution**:
1. Index your codebase: `./scripts/index-codebase.sh`
2. AI will read `.gsd/intel/summary.md` for conventions
3. Be explicit about patterns in prompts

### "Context gets too long"

**Solution**:
1. Start new conversation
2. Load only necessary context
3. Use Ralph Loop (fresh context per task)
