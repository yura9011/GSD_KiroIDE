# GSD for Kiro IDE

A portable, spec-driven development methodology adapted for Kiro IDE.

## About

Get Shit Done (GSD) is a context engineering framework created by [glittercowboy](https://github.com/glittercowboy) that makes AI coding reliable and consistent. This is an adaptation of the [original GSD framework](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done) for Kiro IDE, with full support for Kiro-specific features including hooks, skills, subagents, and slash commands.

## Features

- 25 slash commands for structured development
- Hooks for auto-validation and rule enforcement
- Skills for executable templates with validation
- Subagents for context-efficient operations
- Integration with Kiro's getDiagnostics and context-gatherer
- Portable across all AI coding assistants
- Complete validation scripts

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone this repository into your project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yura9011/GSD_KiroIDE.git
cd GSD_KiroIDE
```

2. Copy the GSD system to your project:
```bash
# Copy .gsd folder
cp -r .gsd /path/to/your/project/

# Copy .kiro integration
cp -r .kiro /path/to/your/project/

# Copy scripts (optional)
cp -r scripts /path/to/your/project/
```

3. Start using GSD in Kiro:
```
/new-project
```

### For New Projects

If you're starting a new project, you can use this repository as a template:

```bash
# Clone into your new project directory
git clone https://github.com/yura9011/GSD_KiroIDE.git my-new-project
cd my-new-project

# Remove the git history to start fresh
rm -rf .git
git init

# Start your project
# Open in Kiro and type: /new-project
```

## Available Commands

### Core Workflow (6)
- `/new-project` - Initialize with deep questioning
- `/map` - Analyze existing codebase
- `/plan [N]` - Create execution plans for phase N
- `/execute [N]` - Implement phase with atomic commits
- `/verify [N]` - Validate with empirical evidence
- `/progress` - Show current position

### Phase Management (6)
- `/discuss-phase [N]` - Clarify scope before planning
- `/research-phase [N]` - Deep technical research
- `/add-phase` - Add phase to roadmap
- `/insert-phase [N]` - Insert urgent phase
- `/remove-phase [N]` - Remove future phase
- `/list-phase-assumptions` - Surface planning assumptions

### Milestone Management (4)
- `/new-milestone [name]` - Start next version
- `/complete-milestone` - Archive and tag release
- `/audit-milestone` - Review quality
- `/plan-milestone-gaps` - Create gap closure plans

### Session Management (4)
- `/pause` - Save state for session handoff
- `/resume` - Restore from last session
- `/add-todo [desc]` - Quick capture idea
- `/check-todos` - List pending items

### Utilities (5)
- `/debug [desc]` - Systematic debugging
- `/help` - Show all commands
- `/update` - Check for GSD updates
- `/whats-new` - Show recent changes
- `/web-search [query]` - Research with web search

## How It Works

### 1. Planning Lock
No code until SPEC.md status is "FINALIZED". This prevents building the wrong thing.

### 2. State Persistence
Update STATE.md after every significant action. Ensures memory across sessions.

### 3. Context Hygiene
3 failures leads to state dump and fresh session. Prevents circular debugging.

### 4. Empirical Validation
Every verification needs proof (screenshots, command output, test results).

## Kiro-Specific Features

### Hooks
- PreToolUse hook for Planning Lock enforcement
- PostToolUse hook for automatic syntax validation
- Prevents code generation before SPEC.md is finalized
- Auto-validates code after file edits

### Skills
- spec-writer: Validates SPEC.md structure programmatically
- roadmap-builder: Ensures ROADMAP.md completeness
- commit-helper: Generates atomic commit messages
- Progressive disclosure pattern for minimal context usage

### Subagents
- map-explorer: Codebase analysis with 99% context savings
- research-agent: Technical research with web access
- verify-agent: Autonomous verification in dontAsk mode
- Context fork pattern isolates high-volume operations

### Slash Commands
- All 25 GSD commands available as native Kiro slash commands
- Organized in subdirectories (phase/, milestone/, session/, util/)
- Argument hints for autocomplete
- Bash pre-execution for context gathering
- File references with @ syntax

## Portability

This GSD setup is completely portable:

- Works with Kiro, Claude Code, Antigravity, or any AI assistant
- All files are markdown (git-friendly)
- No proprietary formats
- Share entire project folder

## Documentation

- `.gsd/SYSTEM.md` - Complete system instructions
- `.gsd/COMMANDS.md` - All commands reference
- `.gsd/workflows/` - Detailed workflow definitions
- `.gsd/examples/` - Usage examples
- `GSD-STYLE.md` - Complete style guide

## Validation

Run validation scripts to verify structure:

```bash
# PowerShell
.\scripts\validate-all.ps1

# Bash
./scripts/validate-all.sh
```

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Initialize project
/new-project

# Analyze existing code (if any)
/map

# Plan first phase
/plan 1

# Execute phase
/execute 1

# Verify work
/verify 1

# Check progress
/progress
```

## Credits

This project is based on [Get Shit Done](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done) by [glittercowboy](https://github.com/glittercowboy).

GSD is a context engineering framework created by glittercowboy that makes AI coding reliable and consistent. The original framework was designed for Claude Code and has been adapted here for Kiro IDE.

### What This Adaptation Adds

This Kiro IDE adaptation extends the original GSD framework with:
- Hooks for auto-validation and Planning Lock enforcement
- Skills with embedded validation scripts
- Subagents with context fork pattern (99% context savings)
- 25 slash commands with argument hints and pre-execution
- Complete Kiro IDE integration while maintaining portability

All core GSD concepts, workflows, and methodology are from the original work by glittercowboy.
