## Discovered Issues

### Resolved
- **Issue**: Analysis was too conservative, marked features as "lost"
  - **Solution**: Corrected analysis - features are implemented or can be implemented universally
  - **Status**: Resolved - documented in `.gsd/archive/ANALYSIS-CORRECTION.md`

- **Issue**: Missing critical documentation for new users
  - **Solution**: Created QUICKSTART.md and brownfield guide
  - **Status**: Resolved - complete onboarding materials now available

- **Issue**: Codebase intelligence seemed IDE-specific
  - **Solution**: Implemented via scripts (no IDE hooks needed)
  - **Status**: Resolved - fully universal implementation

### Active
- **None**: All known issues resolved

### Future Considerations
- **Enhancement**: Test indexing scripts on large codebases (10k+ files)
- **Enhancement**: Benchmark indexing performance
- **Enhancement**: Add incremental indexing optimization
- **Enhancement**: Add caching for faster re-indexing

## Key Decisions

### 1. Universal Over Convenience
**Decision**: Prioritize universality over IDE-specific conveniences  
**Reason**: Works everywhere > works better in one place  
**Impact**: Some features require manual steps, but work in any environment

### 2. Documentation First
**Decision**: Focus on documentation before additional features  
**Reason**: System works perfectly, users can't get started  
**Impact**: Complete onboarding materials, easier adoption

### 3. Scripts Over Hooks
**Decision**: Implement codebase intelligence via scripts, not IDE hooks  
**Reason**: Scripts are universal, hooks are IDE-specific  
**Impact**: Manual or git-hook triggered, but works everywhere

### 4. Three Subagent Patterns
**Decision**: Support automatic, manual, and sequential subagent patterns  
**Reason**: Different AIs have different capabilities  
**Impact**: Works with any AI, from Claude Code to ChatGPT web

## Notes for Future Iterations

### What Works Well
- Universal protocols are truly portable
- Cross-platform scripts work identically
- File-based state is simple and reliable
- Documentation structure is clear
- Codebase intelligence is powerful

### What Could Improve
- Indexing could be faster for large codebases
- More language support needed (currently focused on TS/JS)
- Video tutorials would help visual learners
- More real-world examples needed

### Lessons Learned
1. Universal doesn't mean limited - it means works everywhere
2. Documentation is more critical than features
3. Scripts are more universal than IDE hooks
4. File-based coordination is simple and effective
5. Fresh context per task prevents degradation
